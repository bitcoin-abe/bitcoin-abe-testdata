Transaction/Scripts Test Data
=============================

This folder contains pre-generated test data for testing transaction and
script decoding tests.

The data is generated by the Bitcoin Core CLI tool from the `*.in` files, and
the tests should be easy to extend to other chains by adding chain-specific
transaction data and make rules

Script tests are not implemented yet

The included makefile should help re-generating the files when updated. It
requires `bitcoin-cli` in the PATH. Updated `.json` files should be committed
as well.
